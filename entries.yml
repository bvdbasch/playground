  - title: Change the default folder when saving screenshots on MacOS
    date: "2024.07.02"
    category: macos
    content: |
      By default MacOS saves all screenshots to your desktop. This may be fine for some, but for me it is far from ideal. I'd rather have the screenshots saved to a dedicated screenshots folder. The commands below achieve that.

      ```zsh
      $ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location <new_folder_location>
      $ killall SystemUIServer
      ```

      The first command `defaults write ...` sets the new default location

      The second command `killall` kills the lingering processes, making sure that the new location takes effect the next time you take a screenshot.

      ## Bonus
      I keep forgetting that the screenshot utility has some nifty keyboard shortcuts, so I've jotted the ones I'm interested in here:

      1. When you take a screenshot with `cmd + shift + 4` you can press `space`` to toggle between region and full window for your current screenshot
      2. Use `cmd + shift + 3` to take a screenshot of the whole flippin' screen

  - title: Make TextEdit.app on MacOS behave more like Windows Notepad (notepad.exe)
    date: "2024.04.05"

      Say what you will about Windows, but Notepad.exe is a great tool. It just treats text as plain text. When first switching to MacOS you come to find that Notepad.exe is TextEdit.app, but the problem is that well... It doesn't do plain text out of the box. Instead it does rich text formatting. Fortunately Apple gave us the ability to set plain text as the default. Hurray!

      Here's how to do it:

      1. Open settings (`âŒ˜` + `,`)
      2. On the `New Document` tab in the settings window select the option `Plain text`

      Going forward any new document you create in TextEdit will automatically be in plain text and will be saved as a .txt file. YES!
