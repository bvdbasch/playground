  - title: Change the default folder when saving screenshots on MacOS
    date: "2024.07.02"
    category: macos
    content: |
      By default MacOS saves all screenshots to your desktop. This may be fine for some, but for me it is far from ideal. I'd rather have the screenshots saved to a dedicated screenshots folder. The commands below achieve that.

      ```zsh
      $ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location <new_folder_location>
      $ killall SystemUIServer
      ```

      The first command `defaults write ...` sets the new default location

      The second command `killall` kills the lingering processes, making sure that the new location takes effect the next time you take a screenshot.

      ## Bonus
      I keep forgetting that the screenshot utility has some nifty keyboard shortcuts, so I've jotted the ones I'm interested in here:

      1. When you take a screenshot with `cmd + shift + 4` you can press `space`` to toggle between region and full window for your current screenshot
      2. Use `cmd + shift + 3` to take a screenshot of the whole flippin' screen
