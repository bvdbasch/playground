# TIL: Today I Learned
> [!NOTE]
> {{ entries | length }} TILs in {{ categories | length }} different categories and counting..

This repository contains a collection of concise write-ups on small things I've learned in my day to day journey as a developer. They cover a wide variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full-fledged blog post. In fact, most of the entries in this repository either answer a simple question and are more of a how-to document than they are a journal type entry.

## Categories

{% for category in categories %}
+ [{{ category | capitalize }}](#{{ category | lower }})
{% endfor %}
{% for category in categories %}

### {{ category | capitalize }}

{% for entry in entries if entry['category'] == category %}
+ [{{ entry['title'] }}]({{ entry['category'] }}/{{ entry['title'] | lower | regex_replace('[^A-Za-z0-9]', '-') }}.md)
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
